# React Portfolio

## Description

This website is a portfolio of my work as a developer, it is built with react.
The nav links lead to different sections of the page except for the contact tab which leads to another page within the app.
Flexbox elements and media query work together to elegantly re-organize the page for smaller screens.
The image cards are made dynamic with a hover effect and hyperlinks covering each card. These links lead to deployed applications (when application is deployable), or to the GitHub repository (for downloadable or CLI applications).
The top banner has a circle-cropped photo of me absolutely positioned on it.
